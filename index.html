        <h2>iOS Engineer Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Creativity has always been at the core of everything I do. With a degree in Art, I developed a deep appreciation for design, problem-solving, and innovation. Over time, my curiosity led me to explore technology and coding, where I found a new creative outlet in building software.</p>
        <p>After moving to the U.S., I immersed myself in Full Stack Development. However, it was iOS development, particularly with SwiftUI, that truly excited me. I love bringing ideas to life, and I want to help people through technology, using my skills to create better user experiences that look, feel, and function beautifully.</p>
